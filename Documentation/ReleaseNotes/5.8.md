# SwiftPM 5.8 Release Notes

* [#5728]

In packages that specify resources using tools version 5.8 or later, the generated resource bundle accessor will import `Foundation.Bundle` for its own implementation only. _Clients_ of such packages therefore no longer silently import `Foundation`, preventing inadvertent use of Foundation extensions to standard library APIs, which helps to avoid unexpected code size increases.
